# Windows-Security-Toolsuite <WIP>
A collection of Batch scripts used to gather the current state of a Windows environment.

### ** I created the original collection of these scripts in 2011 to assist in performing risk assessments in a Windows server environment.  I have attempted to recreate the original scripts from memory, and will continue to work on them periodically. ***

## Tools
### sts.cmd
### SysInfo.bat
### Tool template.cmd
### 

#### sts.cmd
This script is responsible for creating the directory structure for the assessment, transferring results, and cleaning up the environment.
