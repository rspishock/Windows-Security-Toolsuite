# Windows-Security-Toolsuite
A collection of Batch scripts used to gather the current state of a Windows environment.

### ** I created the original collection of these scripts in 2011 to assist in performing risk assessments in a Windows server environment.  I have attempted to recreate the original scripts from memory, and will continue to work on them periodically. ***
